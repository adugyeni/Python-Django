This Python-Django project is a comprehensive project built under the supervision of "@programming with Mosh" 
My project involves the use of python programming, html, django framework and other web development resources which were used to build an online retail shop where goods can be added to cart.  
This project was built using the python version 3.10+ on pycharm.
